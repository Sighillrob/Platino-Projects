Platino-Projects
================

Projects built using the Platino Game Engine.
This is the first iteration of a game built on 
Platino inspired by forums of information and tons 
of games like, Galaga, DigDug, Apple Pickin, Candy Crush 
and Zelda(Kinda).  This is only a Beta with lots of functionality
but still needs some things implementd like random messages and Facebook 
sharing, perhaps in V2 those things will come to fruition.


Thanks any questions please feel free to ask on the Lanica.co forums

Thx, 
Rob
